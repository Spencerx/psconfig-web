# TODO

Remove service records that are really old (1 week?) and maybe separate slscache service into a separate service.

when a user login for the first time, I should forward user to install ui that does following
1) make the first user login as super admin
2) create sample testspec / hostgroups / config to show user how to get started

Disallow user from used testspecs / hostgroups (and show which config/test uses them)

migration not receiving queryinterface
